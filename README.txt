***** ASSUMPTIONS AND DEFINITIONS *****
    Because the pinyin system, like any nonphoenetic writing system, has exceptions, we have the following assumptions:
        if a pinyin syllable begins with either 'w' or 'y', we treat the entire syllable as a final and we treat the initial for the
            syllable as if it were the empty string (i.e. "").
